**Executable object-1 denominator:** **239,698 bytes (`0x3A852`)**
**Verified translated instruction bytes:** **0**
**Proven non-code/data bytes:** **0**
**Reconciled object bytes:** **0 / 239,698 = 0.00%**
**Unresolved object bytes:** **239,698**
**Status color:** RED until the entire executable object is instruction-accounted or directly proven non-code/data.

## Immutable source identity

- `CODE.2` size: 558,689 bytes (`0x88661`)
- SHA-256: `853e0a4dfcabebcfeecb975cf2a92b92eb4d94806d835ad30a0bab3e265bd314`
- Object-1 file start: `0x3AF24`
- Object-1 virtual base: `0x10000`
- Object-1 virtual size: `0x3A852`
- Object-1 page count: 59
- Object-1 SHA-256: `014952c4f003c548d928984825bab57dff54ce962dbfae21d7260f19fd3a62f3`
- Entry logical offset: `0x353A0`
- Object-2 virtual base: `0x50000`
- Object-2 virtual size: `0x2DD10`
- Object-2 physical start: `0x75F24`
- Object-2 stored bytes: `0x1273D`

## Measurement rule

The denominator is the complete executable object-1 virtual extent. Count a byte only after it is either:

1. part of an instruction-bounded range translated into `Code2.cpp` and reconciled directly against fresh CODE.2 disassembly; or
2. directly proven to be non-code/data/padding and recorded in a future CODE.2 residual ledger.

Staging, guessed boundaries, CODE.1 similarity, research, scaffolding, and preliminary function matches do not count.

## Bootstrap state

The container and object layout have been established from the uploaded CODE.2. No machine-code bytes have yet been claimed as translated. The first decompilation batch should begin by regenerating object 1 from `0x3AF24`, mapping the entry/startup/runtime regions, and using CODE.1/`Code1.cpp` byte and semantic matches only as leads that are re-proven from CODE.2.
