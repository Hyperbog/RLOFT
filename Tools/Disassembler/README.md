# DOS Disassembler — foundation (Part 14)

Evidence-first DOS disassembly research application. **Early prototype:** command-line analysis only, not yet a desktop app or certified full disassembly. Source files are original-byte read-only; no language generation.

## Requirements

- .NET 10 SDK (see `global.json`)
- NuGet package `Iced` pinned to `1.21.0` (MIT)

## Commands

From `Tools/Disassembler`:

```sh
dotnet run --project src/DosDis.Cli -- inspect /path/to/CODE.2
dotnet run --project src/DosDis.Cli -- disasm /path/to/CODE.2 --object 1 --offset 0x2975C --count 16
dotnet run --project tests/DosDis.Smoke
dotnet run --project tests/DosDis.Smoke -- /path/to/CODE.1 /path/to/CODE.2
```

On the Windows CI job, a self-contained `DOSDis-CLI-win-x64-preview` build artifact is uploaded for testing (not an endorsed production release).

`inspect` emits JSON with immutable source SHA-256, LE module/object/page mappings, entry point, and evidence-tagged File Intelligence fields. `disasm` emits structured instruction records (original bytes, object offset, assembly, flow-control category).

Input is limited to 128 MiB in this prototype as an explicit safety bound. The stored image is copied into memory and never written back. Use an isolated authorized copy of any proprietary original game files; do not add them to this repository.

## Scope and intentionally unsupported features

- Format probe accepts an outer MZ with exactly one validated nested-or-top-level LE module.
- Object/page parser supports ordinary file-backed LE pages (`flags=0`) and represents unfurnished virtual tails as **unmapped**. Iterated/compressed/invalid page types fail closed.
- Relocation **records are not yet decoded or applied**; instruction bytes are original file-backed bytes, not a simulated relocated image.
- Initial assembly decode targets x86 **32-bit LE executable objects** only. The broader 16-bit DOS path needs a dedicated real-mode/segmented loader and execution context.
- CLI listing is *linear disassembly of a researcher-selected address*, not a verified automatic code/data or function discovery pass. It must not be treated as proof that selected bytes were executable.
- File Intelligence fields are identified by full SHA-256 where available; known embedded extender strings are reported as strings, not a proved minimum DOS version.
- No SQLite project, WPF interface, CFG, resource VM decoding, Ghidra import, or binary comparison has been implemented yet. These belong to later milestones.

## Evidence boundary

The repository `Runtime/CODE_OBJECT_MAP.md`, `Code1/FINAL_BINARY_AUDIT.md`, `Code2/FINAL_CERTIFICATION.md`, and the immutable original files control the Ravenloft fixtures.

Verified baseline constraints:

| Field | CODE.1 | CODE.2 |
|---|---:|---:|
| File bytes | 277787 | 558689 |
| Nested MZ start | `0x25D24` | `0x25D24` |
| LE header | `0x27BDC` | `0x27BDC` |
| Object 1 start | `0x2C724` | `0x3AF24` |
| Object 1 virtual length | `0x11302` | `0x3A852` |
| Entry object/offset | `1:0xCC1C` | `1:0x353A0` |

The RLOFT original CODE files **must not be committed** to source control or public release artifacts.

## Development and verification

- `tests/DosDis.Smoke` generates small unencumbered synthetic executable fixtures. Public CI executes those fixtures.
- Optional original-binary tests are activated by supplying original CODE.1 and CODE.2 paths locally.
- The entire Part 14 implementation is isolated under `Tools/Disassembler`; its CI workflow is under `.github/workflows/disassembler-core.yml`.
- Builds are reproducible only after dependency resolution and lock-file creation in the actual .NET build environment. The prototype currently pins the sole third-party package by exact version; a NuGet lock file and package auditing are future gates.
